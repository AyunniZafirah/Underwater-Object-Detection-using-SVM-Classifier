# 🌊 Aquatic Animals Detection using SVM Classifier

This project is an **image classification system** that detects and identifies **7 types of aquatic animals** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.  
It was developed as part of a machine learning / computer vision project to explore how traditional ML models can be applied to real-world problems in underwater environments.  

---

## 🔎 What It Does
- Classifies aquatic animals into 7 categories (e.g., *fish, starfish*).  
- Uses **image preprocessing** and **feature extraction** to prepare the training dataset.  
- Applies a trained **SVM model** (`MODEL.sav`) for prediction.  
- Provides a **web-based GUI app** (`app.py`) for testing with images.

## ℹ️ Note
- **`data2.pickle`** → Saved preprocessed dataset generated by `preprocess.py`.  
- **`MODEL.sav`** → Trained SVM model file, generated during training.  

These files are saved so users don’t need to reprocess or retrain every time, making the system **faster and more consistent**.

## 🌐 Applications
- A reference project for beginners exploring image preprocessing + SVM
- A prototype for simple image classification of underwater animals.
- Educational purposes in computer vision and machine learning
