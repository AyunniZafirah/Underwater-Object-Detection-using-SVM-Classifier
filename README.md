# ðŸŒŠ Underwater Object Detection using SVM Classifier

This project is an **image classification system** that detects and identifies and 7 types of aquatic animals using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.  
It was developed as part of a machine learning / computer vision project to explore how traditional ML models can be applied to real-world problems in underwater environments.

## ðŸ”Ž What It Does

- Classifies aquatic animals into 7 categories (e.g., fish, starfish).  
- Uses **image preprocessing** and **feature extraction** to prepare for training dataset.  
- Applies a trained **SVM model** (stored in `data2.pickle`) for prediction.  
- Provides a **GUI interface** which is a web-based app (`app.py`) for testing with images.  

This can be used as a **foundation** for:  
- Automated underwater monitoring  
- Educational purposes in computer vision and machine learning
