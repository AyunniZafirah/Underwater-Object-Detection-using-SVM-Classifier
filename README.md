# üåä Underwater Object Detection using SVM Classifier

This project is an image classification system that detects and identifies 7 types of aquatic animals using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
It was developed as part of a machine learning / computer vision project to explore how traditional ML models can be applied to real-world problems in underwater environments.

üîé What It Does

‚ó¶Classifies aquatic animals into 7 categories (e.g., fish, starfish).
‚ó¶Uses image preprocessing and feature extraction to prepare the training dataset.
‚ó¶Applies a trained SVM model (stored in MODEL.sav) for prediction.
‚ó¶Provides a GUI interface which is a web-based app (app.py) for testing with images.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note

‚ó¶data2.pickle is the saved preprocessed dataset generated by preprocess.py.
‚ó¶MODEL.sav is the trained SVM model file, also generated during training.
‚ó¶We save these files so users don‚Äôt need to reprocess or retrain every time, making the system faster and more consistent.

This can be used as a foundation for:

‚ó¶Automated underwater monitoring
‚ó¶Educational purposes in computer vision and machine learning
